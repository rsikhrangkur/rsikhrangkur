Hello, I’m Ryan, and I’m a graduate in the field of Computer Science.
I’ve always enjoyed problem solving and the time I spent studying this field has given me a great experience in how I can use my skills in coding and mathematics together
to best look at the information in front of me for solutions needed and problems that aren’t readily apparent.
To this end I wish to jump into a career in data analysis, and would love to take this step with you.
